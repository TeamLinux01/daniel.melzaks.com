With starting this blog up, I am going to need some photos. Probably a lot of them. Since I don't have a lot of money and time, I figured I would jump into the world of Creative Commons works.

I have found this site https://www.pexels.com/ which offers Creative Commons zero works. Here is the license statement https://www.pexels.com/license/. I plan to always give credit to the original photo's creator, although that is not required.

Little by little, I will get this filled with my ideas and wonderful things I find in which I want to share with others. I hope you enjoy mind findings. God bless!
