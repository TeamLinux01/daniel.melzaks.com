I want to share the fun that I have been having playing MtG: Arena. So add me as a friend and play some Friendly Brawl games.

I have several Historic Brawl and a couple of Standard Brawl decks.

Send me a message if you are interested in sending a friend request.

Also come join the [Gamer Radio discord](https://discord.com/invite/k8e7gKUpEp) and sign up for the Thursday Night Brawls, it is a lot of fun. I hope to see you there. God bless!
