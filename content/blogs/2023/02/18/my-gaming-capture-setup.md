Today I wanted to talk about my computer setup at my desk. It is starting to really take shape and I am enjoying it.

The general devices are as follow:

* Gaming/Workstation computer
* Video/Audio capture computer
* Monitor mount with 2 monitors attached. One monitor uses HDMI and the other uses DisplayPort
* Portable HDMI Monitor
* 3.5mm jack speakers
* 3.5mm jack headphones
* Wireless keyboard and wireless trackball
* Tiny wireless keyboard/trackpad
* Ethernet switch
* USB webcam on a stand
* Ring light
* HDMI switch
* HDMI audio extractor
* HDMI splitter
* USB HDMI capture
* Nintendo Switch dock
* Steam Deck dock

I will update this with more details, but it took me a lot longer to make the diagram than I would have liked. God bless!

**Update 2024-05-04:** This has to be redone, as a lot has changed and I had issues with signaling between all the displays and splitters.
