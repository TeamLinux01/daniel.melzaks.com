Thank you for taking the time to read this and any other posts.

I thank God for what he provides for me; my family, home, food, skills and wisdom. I am truly grateful to be alive.

I have learned so much in the last few years, about God, health, people, technology, etc...

I appreciate the interactions I have had and the ones to come. I look forward to the future. I wanted to share my thanks. Praise be unto my God.
