Today I would like to share with you all some software I discovered a few years ago. I haven't used it in a while, but it is always nice to have a great tool on hand. That tool is [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net), which will be used to create a flow chart for my thoughts.

This software can be used stand alone on the website or you can [download the desktop client](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases). Also, for those looking for something in a Linux repo, [Dia, Diagram Editor from Gnome](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Dia) could be a good choice. Whatever works for you, the important part is that you start documenting your thoughts.

I think it is fantastic that we all live in a world where we have so much abundance, such as the ability to thrive with just little amounts of resources. With just a computer, Internet connection and about $6 a month on top of those, I can bring you this blog. Even then if I only had the computer and Internet connection, I could host it on that computer and host it through that connection. It is marvelous what we can accomplish working together and helping others.

I encourage everyone to start creating something, big or small, share it or keep it to your self, it matters not. Just use the gift of creation in your life, solve problems in your physical space or problems other people are experiencing. Talk with each other, learn from each other and love with each other.

My belief is that God created us for a reason, God is love. Emulate God by creating and loving. God bless!
