It's been a while since I posted anything on here and I have been meaning to write something. Well, that something is now!

I am finally getting the hang of github actions. So with this newfound knowledge, I have streamlined the way I can get my words into a file up to making the webserver host the new content.

The short of it is this: I make a new `.md` file in my local git repo with the proper syntaxt so Hugo can generate the pages correctly. I git add and commit my change, push it to github and through the magic that is github actions, it plops the new webserver content on docker hub. From there, I pull the new image and restart the container. DONE!

It makes me happy to be able to simplify and automate these kinds of things. I will probably be talking more about the specifics later on through podcast form.

Hope everyone is doing well and God Bless!
