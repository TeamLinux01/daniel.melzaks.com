Last night my UPS (Uninterrupted Power Supply) 1500VA unit that powers my DSL modem, OPNsense router PC, Fedora home server and a network switch has failed with error code E03.

From what I read about the CyberPower error codes, it is a failed to charge batteries error. To give some history, I purchased two CP1500PFCLCD back in 2016. About a year and a half ago, I bought some replacement batteries for one of them. I believe the UPS unit that failed last night still had the original batteries.

I will be swapping the newer batteries to the failed unit, just to make sure that it isn't the charging circuit; I have read that trying to continually charge failed batteries can damage the circuit.

I pray that I just need to order new batteries, as they can be purchased for around $45 instead of having to replace the entire unit, which is around $220.

I will give an update when I have the issue resolved. God bless!
