I was a guest on the latest episode of Gamer Radio podcast, [Episode 7: A Discord-Side Chat with Dan](https://gamerradio.fireside.fm/7). It was so much fun to chat with Mike about my favorite games and some of the things that are going on in gaming.

I would love to hear some feedback from the listeners, so feel free to reach out. I would say the best way is to join the [Gamer Radio discord group](https://discord.com/invite/k8e7gKUpEp).

I have never done a podcast before, let alone be interviewed by someone else. I would say that my recent implementations in being a more effective communicator are paying off. I praise God for setting me down this path and teaching me what I need to know along the way.

Here are some audio books that helped me get to a better place of communication:

* [Plays Well With Others: The Surprising Science Behind Why Everything You Know About Relationships Is (Mostly) Wrong](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58782858-plays-well-with-others)
* [The Book of Boundaries](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60706850-the-book-of-boundaries)
* [Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077875-essentialism)
* [Effortless: Make It Easier to Do What Matters Most](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54895700-effortless)
* [Dare to Lead](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40109367-dare-to-lead)
* [The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12609433-the-power-of-habit)
* [Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits)

I pray that we all learn to communicate better with each other. Remember to respect each other's beliefs and thoughts, listen to the other person or people before responding and you will get much farther in the conversation and in life. God bless!
