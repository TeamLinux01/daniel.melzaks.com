It's been a while and this year has been very stressful for me. My life has changed so much and I have been very thankful for my friends and family supporting me. I am also thankful for the wonderful people that I work with and I greatly enjoy the work that I do as a support technician.

As for the software I have been personally have been using, I am sticking with TrueNAS CE for my server OS. Running Docker apps on the server is easy enough and I have switched to using Nginx Proxy Manager with custom app settings for putting it on the host network, Tailscale for putting the server on my tailnet and then Audiobookshelf and Jellyfin. My Lenovo 2-in-1 laptop is running Aurora-DX again, as it feels at home with this and I found that I really don't game on it. SteamOS is back on my Steam Deck, as I had some dock issues with Bazzite on it for some reason and SteamOS is great.

I recently bought a newer desktop that has an nVidia RTX GPU and I am surprised with how well the Bazzite open-nVidia install works. I did try out the experimental Deck image for it, but ran into problems; it might have been that I pushed it too really low disk space. It also could not wake up from sleep. Using the normal desktop version, booting directly to Plasma and Steam Big Picture mode work just as well.

I am happy with where I am in life and I plan on cleaning up some of my Github repos, update some documentation and switch my hosted server over to using Nginx Proxy Manager.
