This is very earily in the Owen's class I am taking, Intro to Python, but I wanted to have create ideas for the final. My first idea is to make a Minimalism item tracker. It would require a database to pull off correctly and I know that we will be working with SQL in the later chapters, so I am hopeful. It would provide the user a Graphic User Interface (and even a web interface later) to be able to enter an item. The database entry for the item would store things such as name of the item (string, required), location in home (string, optional), date brought into home (string, optional), purchased price (float, optional), Universal Product Code (string, option), item multiplier (integer, required, defaults to 1) and in home (boolean, required, defaults to true).

Even if this is not made for my final project for the class, I would still like to create this, as I think it would be fun to make, fun to use and help me keep track of some things. I know I still have a lot of things and it would be nice to start writting down these things, so I can have a greater idea at a glance how much stuff I am taking care of.

If you haven't checked out [The Minimalists](https://www.theminimalists.com/), I recommend going to their website and listening to the podcast. You can follow the progress of the application over on the GitHub repository [https://github.com/TeamLinux01/minimalism-item-tracker](https://github.com/TeamLinux01/minimalism-item-tracker). Feel free to engage me there for ideas, discuss the project or even Pull Requests later.
